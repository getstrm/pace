# PACE

PACE is the _Policy and Contract Engine_, whose goal is to ensure that data is only used by those allowed, the way it was intended to be used.

## Running locally

(This has to be improved and parameterized more)

1. Make sure you can connect to all required external hosts (db, platforms, catalogs).
2. Either run the Spring Boot app from the DataPolicyServiceApplication class, or run `make run-docker-local` to build and run a local docker image.
