## Running locally

(This has to be improved and parameterized more)

1. Make sure you can connect to all required external hosts (db, platforms, catalogs).
2. Either run the Spring Boot app from the DataPolicyServiceApplication class, or run `make run-docker-local` to build
   and run a local docker image.
