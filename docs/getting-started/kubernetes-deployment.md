# Kubernetes Deployment

<details>

<summary>Coming soon.</summary>

If you really can't wait for the official docs on getting started with PACE on Kubernetes, here's a pointer on how you can run it. Create a deployment with the PACE container image and expose ports 8080 (a.o. Spring Boot metrics), 9090 (JSON / gRPC proxy), and 50051 (gRPC). Ensure that you've setup Postgres in some way for PACE to connect to. Optionally create a Kubernetes service to connect to PACE.
