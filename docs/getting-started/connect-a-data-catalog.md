# Connect a Data Catalog

PACE can connect to various data catalogs, to retrieve the metadata that these contain about tables. Currently supported are:

* [Collibra](https://www.collibra.com/us/en/resources/enterprise-data-catalogs)
* [Datahub](https://datahubproject.io/)
* [Open Data Discovery](https://opendatadiscovery.org/)

The [Data Catalog Integrations](../reference/data-catalog-integrations/) section goes into detail about how we use their information.

## Connections
Connections to Data Catalogs are [documented here](../reference/data-catalog-integrations/README.md#config).
