# Field Transform

### Introduction

To be able to transform the input data on a field-level, we define `FieldTransforms`. Specific values can be transformed, masked or completely nullified. If no transform is defined for a field, the field will be included in the result set as-is.

The `FieldTransform` consists of a `Field` and a list of `Transforms`. The `Field` is a reference to the corresponding field in the source fields.&#x20;

In order to be able to change the on-view results for different users with different roles, each entry in the list of transforms specifies how to transform the specific field for a set of [`Principals`](../principals.md). Principals can be any set of users as defined in the processing platform for the target view. Every `FieldTransform` for one `Field` should at least contain one `Transform` without any `Principal`, defined as last item in the list. This `Transform` acts as the default or fallback transform for the specified field.

### Transforms

We define 6 types of transforms.

1.  **Regex**

    Replace a value from a field using regular expressions. Beware that you need to match the syntax for regular expressions of your processing platform as defined in the `Target`. E.g., using Snowflake as the processing platform, mask (`****`) the local-part of an email address and keep the domain.

```yaml
regexp:
  regexp: "^.*(@.*)$"
  replacement: "****\\\\1"
```

2.  **Identity**

    Return the original value.&#x20;

```yaml
identity: {}
```

3.  **Fixed Value**

    Replace a field with a fixed value

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml"><strong>fixed:
</strong>  value: "****"
</code></pre>

4.  **Hash**

    Hash a field using an optional seed. The  hashing algorithm depends on the processing platform of your choice.

```yaml
hash:
  seed: "1234"
```

5.  **SQL Statement**

    Execute a SQL statement to transform the field value. The exact syntax is platform-specific.

```yaml
sql_statement:
  statement: "CASE WHEN haircolor = 'blonde' THEN 'fair' ELSE 'dark' END"
```

6.  **Nullify**

    Make the field value null.

```yaml
nullify: {}
```

### Example Field Transform

Below you will find an example of a set of `Field Transform`. Note that for each set of `Transform` the last one always is without defined principals.

```yaml
field_transforms:
  - field:
      name_parts: [ userid ]
      type: "string"
      required: true
    transforms:
      - principals: [ "FRAUD_AND_RISK"]
        identity: {}
      - principals: [ "MARKETING" ]
        nullify: {}
      - principals: []
        hash:
          seed: "1234"
  - field:
      name_parts: [ email ]
      type: "string"
      required: true
    transforms:
      - principals: [ MARKETING ]
        regexp:
          regexp: "^.*(@.*)$"
          replacement: "****\\\\1"
      - principals: [ FRAUD_AND_RISK ]
        identity: {}
      - principals: []
        fixed:
          value: "****"
  - field:
      name_parts: [ haircolor ]
      type: "string"
      required: true
    transforms:
      - principals: []
        sql_statement:
          statement: "CASE WHEN haircolor = 'blonde' THEN 'fair' ELSE 'dark' END"

```
