# dbt module

This PACE module is used to extend dbt with Data Policies as PACE knows them.

## Setup

Assuming that you have a Python environment set up (feel free to use Pipenv, Virtualenv, etc), you
can install the required packages with the following command:

```shell
pip install dbt-postgres
```

The directory `dbt_sample_project` has been created with the following command:

```shell
dbt init dbt_sample_project
dbt seed
```

## To do

- Ensure it's possible to extend an existing ruleset with a global transform
- Global rulesets may result in duplicate target refs
- Parse ruleset configuration from manifest (allow specifying Data Policy Rule sets in the manifest meta section)
- Write PACE view SQL to models dir, taking target ref into account.
- Write PACE view schema yamls to models dir.
- add autogenerated header for generated sql files to instruct the user to the correct workflow.
